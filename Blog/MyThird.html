<h3>Understanding User Alignment</h3>
<p>When designing for the web, user alignment is crucial to ensure that a website serves its audience effectively. My site is designed for students, with a focus on an engaging portfolio case. By aligning design choices with user needs, I aim to create an intuitive and engaging experience. To achieve this, I prioritize user goals, ensuring that content is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
<h3>Mapping out my site</h3>
<p>The structure of my site is designed to provide users with clear and meaningful information. The homepage offers an engaging introduction with a strong call to action, while the About Page provides background information on the site’s purpose. The Blog and essay pages deliver informative articles, and the portfolio page will provide artistic content.</p>
<p>Crafting a seamless user experience involves implementing a system that allows users to access specific content without going through tons of pages. A clear visual hierarchy using typography, spacing, and colour contrast enhances readability. We should also craft the UX in such a way that its able to adapt to different screen sizes making it accessible in different devices.</p>
<p>Every interface element plays a role in usability. The navigation bar provides easy-to-access menu options, while well-placed buttons and call-to-action prompts guide user interactions. Forms are designed to be simple and user-friendly, making data input effortless. Optimized media elements, including images and videos, contribute to an engaging and visually appealing experience.</p>

<h3>Development process</h3>
<p>As of right now, the development of my website is quite slow as I’m still getting used to as well learning the HTML language. However, I can confidently say that my website is coming together however I’m still having trouble with a feature I’m hoping to implement in my website.</p>
<p>One of these features is allowing users to return to the home page at the click of a button without using the browser’s back function. I plan to achieve this by incorporating a "Home" button in the navigation menu that links directly to the homepage.</p>
<p>Another feature I'm hoping to implement is having the blogs and blog tabs share a page, so users don’t have to navigate to other pages. They will be able to read the blogs on the same page without unnecessary going through other pages. This will improve user experience by keeping the content easily accessible and reducing wait times</p>
