        <h2>Week 1</h2>

                <h2>1. Reading</h2>
                <p>The reading I have done for the first week is Berners-Lee et al. - 1994 - The World-Wide Web.</p>
        
                <p>Reading Berners-Lee’s *The World-Wide Web* feels like witnessing the first steps into the birth of a new age. 
                In 1994, the Web was an instrument used by scientists to share information. Yet, it quickly spread beyond academia, thanks to browsers such as Netscape, making the internet accessible to everyone.</p>
        
                <p>The article highlights the Web’s powerful foundation, such as hypertext, URLs, and HTTP. What once seemed extraordinary in the early years of the Web now feels second nature, shaping how we communicate, learn, and work. However, with this sudden growth, challenges emerged, including privacy concerns and misinformation.</p>
        
                <p>Looking back, it’s incredible to see how one idea transformed the world. The Web started as a tool for sharing knowledge, but today, it defines our digital lives.</p>

                <h2>2. Setting up GitHub and Publishing Pages</h2>
                <p>Doing this was relatively simple, as I gained a lot of experience with it throughout 2024 in my Game Design module, where I worked with the Unity engine and C#. However, when using it with HTML and Visual Studio Code, it felt much simpler than with Unity.</p>

                <h2>3. History of the Web</h2>
                <p>The World Wide Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues. Initially, it was an instrument used by scientists to share information, but it quickly spread to the public thanks to browsers such as Netscape.</p>

                <h2>4. Course Goals</h2>
                <p>I fully hope to take advantage of this course to learn more about web design, allowing me to broaden my portfolio and expand my opportunities.</p>
