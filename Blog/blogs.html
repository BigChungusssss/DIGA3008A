        <h2>Week 1</h2> 
    

                <h3>1. Reading</h3>
                <p>The reading I have done for the first week is Berners-Lee et al. - 1994 - The World-Wide Web.</p>
        
                <p>Reading Berners-Lee’s *The World-Wide Web* feels like witnessing the first steps into the birth of a new age. 
                In 1994, the Web was an instrument used by scientists to share information. Yet, it quickly spread beyond academia, thanks to browsers such as Netscape, making the internet accessible to everyone.</p>
        
                <p>The article highlights the Web’s powerful foundation, such as hypertext, URLs, and HTTP. What once seemed extraordinary in the early years of the Web now feels second nature, shaping how we communicate, learn, and work. However, with this sudden growth, challenges emerged, including privacy concerns and misinformation.</p>
        
                <p>Looking back, it’s incredible to see how one idea transformed the world. The Web started as a tool for sharing knowledge, but today, it defines our digital lives.</p>
                <h3>2. Setting up GitHub and Publishing Pages</h3>
                <p>Doing this was relatively simple, as I gained a lot of experience with it throughout 2024 in my Game Design module, where I worked with the Unity engine and C#. However, when using it with HTML and Visual Studio Code, it felt much simpler than with Unity.</p>

                <h3>3. History of the Web</h3>
                <p>The World Wide Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues. Initially, it was an instrument used by scientists to share information, but it quickly spread to the public thanks to browsers such as Netscape.</p>

                <h3>4. Course Goals</h3>
                <p>I fully hope to take advantage of this course to learn more about web design, allowing me to broaden my portfolio and expand my opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    
        <section>
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                In his essay, <i>"You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media,"</i> 
                Stuart Moulthrop explores the promises and paradoxes of hypertext, 
                tracing its roots while questioning its revolutionary potential. 
                Inspired by philosophers such as Marshall McLuhan and Theodore Nelson, 
                Moulthrop examines whether hypertext can truly democratize knowledge or 
                if it will simply fall under corporate control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertext, as envisioned by pioneers like Nelson, 
                was meant to free knowledge from linear constraints. 
                Yet, as Moulthrop notes, this dream has largely been overshadowed by commercial platforms like 
                Yahoo! and CNN, where information flows in a structured, consumption-driven manner 
                rather than in an open, participatory web.
            </p>
            <p>
                While hypertext was once imagined as a force for radical change, 
                Moulthrop warns that without active resistance, 
                it risks being co-opted into a controlled, commercialized system. 
                The revolution may not be as inevitable as we once hoped.

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <h3>Understanding User Alignment</h3>
        <p>When designing for the web, user alignment is crucial to ensure that a website serves its audience effectively. My site is designed for students, with a focus on an engaging portfolio case. By aligning design choices with user needs, I aim to create an intuitive and engaging experience. To achieve this, I prioritize user goals, ensuring that content is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
        <h3>Mapping out my site</h3>
        <p>The structure of my site is designed to provide users with clear and meaningful information. The homepage offers an engaging introduction with a strong call to action, while the About Page provides background information on the site’s purpose. The Blog and essay pages deliver informative articles, and the portfolio page will provide artistic content.</p>
        <p>Crafting a seamless user experience involves implementing a system that allows users to access specific content without going through tons of pages. A clear visual hierarchy using typography, spacing, and colour contrast enhances readability. We should also craft the UX in such a way that its able to adapt to different screen sizes making it accessible in different devices.</p>
        <p>Every interface element plays a role in usability. The navigation bar provides easy-to-access menu options, while well-placed buttons and call-to-action prompts guide user interactions. Forms are designed to be simple and user-friendly, making data input effortless. Optimized media elements, including images and videos, contribute to an engaging and visually appealing experience.</p>

        <h3>Development process</h3>
        <p>As of right now, the development of my website is quite slow as I’m still getting used to as well learning the HTML language. However, I can confidently say that my website is coming together however I’m still having trouble with a feature I’m hoping to implement in my website.</p>
        <p>One of these features is allowing users to return to the home page at the click of a button without using the browser’s back function. I plan to achieve this by incorporating a "Home" button in the navigation menu that links directly to the homepage.</p>
        <p>Another feature I'm hoping to implement is having the blogs and blog tabs share a page, so users don’t have to navigate to other pages. They will be able to read the blogs on the same page without unnecessary going through other pages. This will improve user experience by keeping the content easily accessible and reducing wait times</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>My original wireframe does resemble my current vision of how I envision my website, but I would like to convey a lot more information to the user. For example, I want to include a summary of each blog post that users can read before deciding to engage with the full article. Additionally, it would be great to have a dedicated section where users can easily view updates and highlights on a specific page.</p>

            <h3>Reflection on Website</h3>
            <p>While working on my first website, I struggled to integrate dedicated pages for certain sections, such as blogs or essays. Instead, I initially had all blog posts on a single page until I learned how to properly reference files. I also managed to create a dedicated home button that allows users to navigate back to the homepage. Although I would have liked to make the website much neater and more visually appealing, this was one of the areas I found particularly challenging.</p>

    <h2>Week 10</h2>
  <h3>Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb: Challenging the “Death of Distance”</h3>
  <p>
    Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb challenge the old idea of the “death of distance” by showing that the internet’s impact on economic geography is deeply uneven. Instead of flattening the world, the Internet amplifies differences between regions based on local preferences, available substitutes, and complements like broadband infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their central argument is that the Internet reduces three kinds of costs—communication, transportation, and search—but the benefits of these reductions vary dramatically by location. The authors support this by reviewing a wide range of studies, from wage growth patterns to innovation trends, all pointing to the same story: geography still matters.
  </p>

  <h4>The Death of Distance</h4>
  <p>
    The chapter opens with a nuanced take on the “death of distance” theory, challenging its simplifying assumptions. While the Internet reduces frictions, it does not do so uniformly. For example, face-to-face interactions still dominate in transferring “sticky” tacit knowledge (von Hippel, 1998; Storper and Venables, 2004). IT can complement, rather than substitute for, geographic proximity—especially in collaborative innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    This directly aligns with Gaspar and Glaeser’s (1998) model: the internet might increase demand for face-to-face interactions for complex tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    This argument correctly resists technological determinism. Technological changes (like the Internet) interact with existing social and economic structures instead of automatically flattening them.
  </p>

  <h4>Adoption Patterns</h4>
  <p>
    The Internet spreads deeply geographically uneven. Firms in rural areas see potential value but face adoption barriers due to lack of broadband, skilled labour, and outsourcing markets. Individuals’ internet adoption correlates with urban density and social spillovers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forman found that basic Internet adoption had greater benefits for small towns, but advanced Internet technologies concentrated in cities. This distinction between basic vs advanced IT adoption remains underexplored in more recent tech research.
  </p>
  <p>
    One major insight is how the Internet widened economic inequality: richer, tech-heavy cities like San Francisco benefited more than isolated regions, despite early hopes that the Internet would help everyone equally. This echoes findings from Moretti’s <em>The New Geography of Jobs</em> (2012), showing that tech advantages concentrate.

      <h2>Week 12</h2>
  <h3>Decolonialism</h3>
  <p>
    When thinking about how our code matters in the context of decolonialism, I’ve started to question how inclusive and accessible my development decisions really are. While this theme is broad, it influences the way I approach building digital spaces—especially when considering user experience, accessibility, and cultural assumptions embedded in design patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    To respond to this, I’ve been updating my website to feel more interactive and user-friendly, using JavaScript to create a more flexible, intuitive experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    To incorporate JavaScript into my site, I had to restructure parts of the HTML and CSS to support dynamic behavior. I introduced a burger menu to simplify navigation, especially for mobile users. I also added page transitions to avoid jarring reloads when moving between sections, and built blog cards that reveal a short snippet of the post, with more detail appearing on hover.
  </p>
  <p>
    These updates significantly streamlined my interaction design. The burger menu reduces clutter and helps users access different sections quickly. Smooth transitions between pages make the site feel more cohesive and less disruptive. And the hover-enabled blog cards give users just enough context to explore posts without overwhelming them with information upfront.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, JavaScript helped turn a static experience into a dynamic, responsive one. It made the site not only look better—but feel better to use.

    <h2>Week 13</h2>
     <h3>What Does an Ethical Internet Look Like to Me?</h3>
  <p>
    To me, an ethical internet is one where people—not algorithms—come first. It’s a digital space built on transparency, privacy, and respect for human dignity. It’s an ecosystem where creators are credited fairly, users understand how their data is used, and platforms are accountable for the harm they enable or ignore.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ethical internet doesn’t manipulate, exploit, or addict. Instead, it empowers people with truthful information, and control over their online experience. It prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity, giving everyone a voice and a chance to participate.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also means safety by design: protection from harassment, misinformation, and surveillance. Ethical design should focus on consent, clarity, and community.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an ethical internet, digital wellbeing matters. Time online should feel enriching—not draining. Interfaces should inform, not deceive. And developers and designers should carry a sense of social responsibility, recognizing that the tools they create shape how millions of people experience the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, an ethical internet is not just a technical ideal but a moral one—requiring ongoing effort, humility, and accountability.
  </p>
