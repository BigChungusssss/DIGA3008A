                <h3>1. Reading</h3>
                <p>The reading I have done for the first week is Berners-Lee et al. - 1994 - The World-Wide Web.</p>
        
                <p>Reading Berners-Lee’s *The World-Wide Web* feels like witnessing the first steps into the birth of a new age. 
                In 1994, the Web was an instrument used by scientists to share information. Yet, it quickly spread beyond academia, thanks to browsers such as Netscape, making the internet accessible to everyone.</p>
        
                <p>The article highlights the Web’s powerful foundation, such as hypertext, URLs, and HTTP. What once seemed extraordinary in the early years of the Web now feels second nature, shaping how we communicate, learn, and work. However, with this sudden growth, challenges emerged, including privacy concerns and misinformation.</p>
        
                <p>Looking back, it’s incredible to see how one idea transformed the world. The Web started as a tool for sharing knowledge, but today, it defines our digital lives.</p>
                <h3>2. Setting up GitHub and Publishing Pages</h3>
                <p>Doing this was relatively simple, as I gained a lot of experience with it throughout 2024 in my Game Design module, where I worked with the Unity engine and C#. However, when using it with HTML and Visual Studio Code, it felt much simpler than with Unity.</p>

                <h3>3. History of the Web</h3>
                <p>The World Wide Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues. Initially, it was an instrument used by scientists to share information, but it quickly spread to the public thanks to browsers such as Netscape.</p>

                <h3>4. Course Goals</h3>
                <p>I fully hope to take advantage of this course to learn more about web design, allowing me to broaden my portfolio and expand my opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                In his essay, <i>"You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media,"</i> 
                Stuart Moulthrop explores the promises and paradoxes of hypertext, 
                tracing its roots while questioning its revolutionary potential. 
                Inspired by philosophers such as Marshall McLuhan and Theodore Nelson, 
                Moulthrop examines whether hypertext can truly democratize knowledge or 
                if it will simply fall under corporate control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertext, as envisioned by pioneers like Nelson, 
                was meant to free knowledge from linear constraints. 
                Yet, as Moulthrop notes, this dream has largely been overshadowed by commercial platforms like 
                Yahoo! and CNN, where information flows in a structured, consumption-driven manner 
                rather than in an open, participatory web.
            </p>
            <p>
                While hypertext was once imagined as a force for radical change, 
                Moulthrop warns that without active resistance, 
                it risks being co-opted into a controlled, commercialized system. 
                The revolution may not be as inevitable as we once hoped.

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <h4>Understanding User Alignment</h4>
        <p>When designing for the web, user alignment is crucial to ensure that a website serves its audience effectively. My site is designed for students, with a focus on an engaging portfolio case. By aligning design choices with user needs, I aim to create an intuitive and engaging experience. To achieve this, I prioritize user goals, ensuring that content is accessible and easy to navigate.</p>
        <h3>Mapping out my site</h3>
        <p>The structure of my site is designed to provide users with clear and meaningful information. The homepage offers an engaging introduction with a strong call to action, while the About Page provides background information on the site’s purpose. The Blog and essay pages deliver informative articles, and the portfolio page will provide artistic content.</p>
        <p>Crafting a seamless user experience involves implementing a system that allows users to access specific content without going through tons of pages. A clear visual hierarchy using typography, spacing, and colour contrast enhances readability. We should also craft the UX in such a way that its able to adapt to different screen sizes making it accessible in different devices.</p>
        <p>Every interface element plays a role in usability. The navigation bar provides easy-to-access menu options, while well-placed buttons and call-to-action prompts guide user interactions. Forms are designed to be simple and user-friendly, making data input effortless. Optimized media elements, including images and videos, contribute to an engaging and visually appealing experience.</p>

        <h3>Development process</h3>
        <p>As of right now, the development of my website is quite slow as I’m still getting used to as well learning the HTML language. However, I can confidently say that my website is coming together however I’m still having trouble with a feature I’m hoping to implement in my website.</p>
        <p>One of these features is allowing users to return to the home page at the click of a button without using the browser’s back function. I plan to achieve this by incorporating a "Home" button in the navigation menu that links directly to the homepage.</p>
        <p>Another feature I'm hoping to implement is having the blogs and blog tabs share a page, so users don’t have to navigate to other pages. They will be able to read the blogs on the same page without unnecessary going through other pages. This will improve user experience by keeping the content easily accessible and reducing wait times</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>My original wireframe does resemble my current vision of how I envision my website, but I would like to convey a lot more information to the user. For example, I want to include a summary of each blog post that users can read before deciding to engage with the full article. Additionally, it would be great to have a dedicated section where users can easily view updates and highlights on a specific page.</p>

            <p>While working on my first website, I struggled to integrate dedicated pages for certain sections, such as blogs or essays. Instead, I initially had all blog posts on a single page until I learned how to properly reference files. I also managed to create a dedicated home button that allows users to navigate back to the homepage. Although I would have liked to make the website much neater and more visually appealing, this was one of the areas I found particularly challenging.</p>

    <h3>Blog Reflection – Reading 1: <em>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</em> by Claire Daniolou</h3>
    <p>
      Daniolou makes a compelling case for reimagining internet access not as a luxury, but as a basic human need. As digital life becomes increasingly central to education, work, and community, those without access to broadband are left behind—not just technologically, but socially and economically. The idea of the “rural penalty” especially stood out: isolation from the digital world means isolation from opportunity, visibility, and development.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I found most powerful was the emphasis on the dual challenge of connectivity and digital literacy. Providing access is only half the battle—ensuring people know how to use the internet meaningfully is just as critical. Daniolou’s argument positions broadband not just as infrastructure, but as a tool for global justice and inclusion.
    </p>


 
    <h3>Blog Reflection – Reading 2: <em>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</em> by Spyros Kasapis</h3>
    <p>
      Kasapis expands the conversation about digital inequality by framing internet access as not just a technical need but a human right. The pandemic made this point painfully clear: without reliable internet, millions were cut off from work, school, and even healthcare. The internet became a lifeline—and those without it were left adrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      What stood out most was the reminder that digital exclusion mirrors economic and political inequality. While tech giants profited, half the planet remained disconnected. Kasapis challenges us to rethink internet infrastructure as a matter of justice, not just convenience. His call to democratize digital access aligns strongly with broader movements for inclusion, equity, and human dignity in the digital age.

        <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-29T12:00:00Z">March 29, 2025</time>

  <h3>Introduction: The Geography of a Borderless Technology</h3>
  <p>
    In their chapter from <em>The New Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography</em>, Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb present a nuanced exploration of how the Internet reshapes economic geography. Far from championing the “death of distance,” the authors argue that the impact of the Internet varies significantly by place due to local differences in preferences, substitutes, and complements. This essay provides a close reading of their work, analyzing their aims, methods, and conclusions, and situates it within broader academic conversations about digital technology, urban economics, and inequality.
  </p>

  <h3>Aims and Framework</h3>
  <p>
    The authors aim to assess how the Internet alters geographical patterns of economic activity. Their central thesis is that while the Internet reduces three core economic frictions—communication, transportation, and search costs—these reductions do not benefit all places equally. Instead, the benefits are unevenly shaped by economic structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chapter is structured around an empirical literature review organized by thematic sections: the “death of distance” hypothesis, Internet adoption, wealth and productivity, innovation, consumer behavior, and globalization. Each section builds toward a cumulative critique of oversimplified claims that digital technologies flatten spatial inequalities.
  </p>

  <h3>“Death of Distance”</h3>
  <p>
    The authors begin by dismantling the widely cited “death of distance” idea from Cairncross (1997) and Friedman (2005). They point out that while some digital technologies substitute for face-to-face interaction, others complement it.
  </p>

  <h3>Internet Adoption and Urban-Rural Divergence</h3>
  <p>
    Forman et al. (2005) show that rural areas, despite needing the Internet the most to overcome economic isolation, often lack the necessary complementary inputs such as skilled labor and broadband infrastructure. This paradox illustrates the authors’ broader theme: geography shapes technological benefit. Urban areas, with richer ecosystems, realize more value from advanced IT systems, whereas rural regions face higher adoption barriers and realize smaller returns.
  </p>

  <h3>Wealth, Wages, and the “Payoff Puzzle”</h3>
  <p>
    Perhaps the most striking finding is the “payoff puzzle” noted by Forman et al. (2012): only 6% of U.S. counties experienced significant wage growth from Internet investment. These counties already had high income, skills, and IT use pre-1995. This suggests the Internet has not been a great equalizer, but rather a force for deepening inequality.
  </p>

  <h3>Innovation and the Geography of Ideas</h3>
  <p>
    The Internet’s impact on innovation appears more democratizing. Internet use facilitates research collaboration across distant geographies—particularly within firms—potentially diffusing innovation away from traditional urban hubs. Yet even here, benefits are uneven: top-tier institutions gain more, and co-location remains important for highly complex collaborations.
  </p>

  <h3>Consumer Behavior and Local Variation</h3>
  <p>
    The Internet empowers consumers by lowering prices and expanding choice—especially for those in “preference minorities” or remote areas. Yet consumer behaviour online is still heavily shaped by geography. Users tend to patronize geographically local websites and prefer locally relevant content. Hence, the Internet does not erase local cultures; it reflects and even amplifies them.
  </p>

  <h3>Global Trade and Fragmentation</h3>
  <p>
    In discussing globalization, the authors highlight that while the Internet facilitates service exports and global supply chain integration, the benefits are skewed toward countries and firms with high technological and organizational capacity.
  </p>

  <h3>Critical Reflection and Additional Context</h3>
  <p>
    The authors successfully dismantle techno-optimist assumptions about the Internet’s ability to democratize economic opportunity. However, their work also opens critical questions: If the Internet increases inequality across places, how might policy address this divergence?
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, comparing their findings with recent mobile Internet literature suggests that smartphone-driven behaviors could offer a new layer of geography-mediated opportunity—or exclusion.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb deliver a sophisticated, evidence-based account of how geography and the Internet shape one another. Their key insight—that the Internet’s benefits are mediated by offline conditions—compels scholars and policymakers to rethink digital inclusion. Rather than assuming universal benefit, we must ask: <em>Which places gain from the Internet, and why?</em> Only by grappling with these complexities can we build a truly equitable digital economy.

    <h3>Critical Reflection – Digital Inequalities in the Age of AI and Big Data, by Lutz</h3>
    <p>
      Lutz’s analysis of digital inequalities strikes me. As someone interested in technology and design, I’ve often seen digital access framed as a checkbox issue—if people have internet, the problem is solved. But Lutz challenges this notion through a layered understanding of inequality: <strong>access</strong>, <strong>skills</strong>, and <strong>outcomes</strong>. This framework helped me realize that even those who appear “connected” might still be excluded in more subtle, systemic ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      What resonates most is his focus on divide—the idea that even if people have access and skills, the benefits they derive from technology can differ dramatically. I’ve seen this firsthand in educational settings where students might all be using the same tools but only some gain meaningful, empowering results. Lutz’s example of smart speakers acting like “prison yards” rather than open platforms speaks volumes to how even helpful technologies can reinforce exclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critically, this reading pushes me to rethink the ethics of design and data. Lutz reminds us that algorithmic systems aren't neutral; they carry the weight of social structures and often amplify existing bias. This raises hard questions for me as a developer: How do we avoid building tools that only serve the already empowered? 
    </p>
    <p>
      In reflecting on this, I’m reminded that coding isn’t just technical. Every design choice carries ethical consequences, and this reading makes clear that digital inequality isn’t disappearing. It’s evolving. And if we’re not paying attention, we risk embedding it deeper into the systems we create.

  <h3>Decolonialism</h3>
  <p>
    When thinking about how our code matters in the context of decolonialism, I’ve started to question how inclusive and accessible my development decisions really are. While this theme is broad, it influences the way I approach building digital spaces—especially when considering user experience, accessibility, and cultural assumptions embedded in design patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    To respond to this, I’ve been updating my website to feel more interactive and user-friendly, using JavaScript to create a more flexible, intuitive experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    To incorporate JavaScript into my site, I had to restructure parts of the HTML and CSS to support dynamic behavior. I introduced a burger menu to simplify navigation, especially for mobile users. I also added page transitions to avoid jarring reloads when moving between sections, and built blog cards that reveal a short snippet of the post, with more detail appearing on hover.
  </p>
  <p>
    These updates significantly streamlined my interaction design. The burger menu reduces clutter and helps users access different sections quickly. Smooth transitions between pages make the site feel more cohesive and less disruptive. And the hover-enabled blog cards give users just enough context to explore posts without overwhelming them with information upfront.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, JavaScript helped turn a static experience into a dynamic, responsive one. It made the site not only look better—but feel better to use.

     <h3>What Does an Ethical Internet Look Like to Me?</h3>
  <p>
    To me, an ethical internet is one where people—not algorithms—come first. It’s a digital space built on transparency, privacy, and respect for human dignity. It’s an ecosystem where creators are credited fairly, users understand how their data is used, and platforms are accountable for the harm they enable or ignore.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ethical internet doesn’t manipulate, exploit, or addict. Instead, it empowers people with truthful information, and control over their online experience. It prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity, giving everyone a voice and a chance to participate.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also means safety by design: protection from harassment, misinformation, and surveillance. Ethical design should focus on consent, clarity, and community.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an ethical internet, digital wellbeing matters. Time online should feel enriching—not draining. Interfaces should inform, not deceive. And developers and designers should carry a sense of social responsibility, recognizing that the tools they create shape how millions of people experience the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, an ethical internet is not just a technical ideal but a moral one—requiring ongoing effort, humility, and accountability.

        <h3>Code, Creation, and Conscience: A Reflection on Ethics in Digital Practice</h3>
      <p>In both my programming and artistic practice, I believe ethics must be more than an afterthought. Whether I'm writing code or crafting an interactive experience, I’ve come to understand that every decision I make — from visual design to data handling — has ethical weight. As we increasingly inhabit digital spaces, the question of how justice manifests in our creative and technical work becomes both urgent and unavoidable.</p>

      <p>One of the most pressing responsibilities I feel is the need to design for inclusivity. Accessible design is not just a feature — it’s a foundation. Using semantic HTML, descriptive alt text, and proper ARIA roles isn’t just about following standards; it’s about recognizing that digital spaces, like physical ones, must accommodate everyone. Sara Hendren’s <em>What Can a Body Do?</em> reshaped the way I see accessibility. Her work urges us to view disability not as a limitation, but as a perspective that can lead to richer, more thoughtful design. When I build interfaces or interactive experiences, I try to ask: who might this exclude? Whose needs are left out?</p>

      <p>This leads naturally into the importance of transparency. In an era dominated by opaque algorithms and hidden data collection, I see a commitment to honesty as an ethical imperative. I am intentional about avoiding hidden trackers or collecting unnecessary information. If a project uses automation or AI, users should know — clearly and up front. Ruha Benjamin’s <em>Race After Technology</em> highlights the ways that even well-intentioned code can reinforce bias if developers don't reflect deeply on the social systems their tools operate within. Her insights challenge me to examine my assumptions at every stage of development.</p>

      <p>Beyond inclusivity and transparency, I think deeply about consent and agency. Whether a user is navigating a website or interacting with an artwork, they should always feel that they are participating voluntarily. Dark patterns — like sneaky cookie banners or manipulative button layouts — are not just bad UX, they are unethical. I want users to feel respected, not coerced. Reading Shoshana Zuboff’s <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> opened my eyes to the quiet invasions of privacy that have become normalized in tech culture, and made me more conscious of resisting them in my own work.</p>

      <p>Art, too, has ethical obligations. It is tempting to use provocative themes without fully understanding their impact — but I’ve come to believe that every creative choice carries responsibility. If I choose to depict trauma, injustice, or identity, I must approach those themes with care, humility, and a willingness to listen. bell hooks’ concept of the “oppositional gaze” reminds me that representation can either reinforce or challenge power structures. It’s not enough to say something visually compelling — I also have to ask: who is centered? Who is erased?</p>

      <p>In the world of code, I also think often about community and openness. Much of my learning comes from open-source tools, libraries, and tutorials. I try to give back when I can — whether through clear documentation, sharing my own code, or simply crediting the people whose work I’ve built on. Lawrence Lessig’s <em>Free Culture</em> reinforces this idea of ethical sharing. He argues for a more participatory digital commons — something I wholeheartedly support.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, justice and ethics are not separate from creative or technical work. They are deeply embedded within it. They shape not only <em>what</em> we make, but <em>how</em> we make it, and <em>who</em> we make it for. For me, practicing ethics means building with empathy, designing for diversity, being transparent about intention, and staying open to critique. It means remembering that behind every click or line of code is a person — and that person deserves respect.</p>
