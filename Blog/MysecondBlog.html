                In his essay, <i>"You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media,"</i> 
                Stuart Moulthrop explores the promises and paradoxes of hypertext, 
                tracing its roots while questioning its revolutionary potential. 
                Inspired by philosophers such as Marshall McLuhan and Theodore Nelson, 
                Moulthrop examines whether hypertext can truly democratize knowledge or 
                if it will simply fall under corporate control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypertext, as envisioned by pioneers like Nelson, 
                was meant to free knowledge from linear constraints. 
                Yet, as Moulthrop notes, this dream has largely been overshadowed by commercial platforms like 
                Yahoo! and CNN, where information flows in a structured, consumption-driven manner 
                rather than in an open, participatory web.
            </p>
            <p>
                While hypertext was once imagined as a force for radical change, 
                Moulthrop warns that without active resistance, 
                it risks being co-opted into a controlled, commercialized system. 
                The revolution may not be as inevitable as we once hoped.
