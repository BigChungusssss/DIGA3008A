  <p>User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) play a very integral role in shaping how people interact with digital platforms. As financial services, such as banking, move increasingly online, ethical considerations in digital interaction design are becoming vital. Digital banking platforms are not only responsible for providing functional services but also for ensuring their designs do not marginalize or mislead users. This paper examines the UI and UX design of Capitec Bank’s website, a leading South African banking platform, to explore how it facilitates interaction and whether it aligns with ethical design standards. Using both primary interaction analysis and supporting literature, this paper investigates the visual design, usability, and ethical implications of Capitec’s online platform.</p>

  <p>Capitec Bank is one of South Africa’s largest retail banks, known for its digital approach to affordable banking services. Its website provides a wide range of financial tools, including online banking, account management, loan applications, savings options, and customer support. With over 21 million clients, many of whom rely heavily on mobile or web-based banking due to limited access to physical branches, Capitec’s website is a crucial point of interaction between the bank and its customers. In the context of South Africa, where digital literacy levels vary and internet connectivity is often uneven, Capitec’s website plays a vital role in promoting financial inclusion. As such, the platform must be evaluated not only for usability but also for how ethically it serves its diverse user base.</p>

  <p>Capitec’s website uses a clean, minimalist layout characterized by a predominantly white background and blue accents, which align with the bank’s overall branding. The interface is visually appealing and emphasizes simplicity, which is beneficial for users who may not be highly digitally literate. The typography is clear, readable, and appropriately sized, with sufficient spacing to minimize cognitive overload. Interactive elements, such as buttons and menus, are distinct and consistently styled throughout the site.</p>

  <p>However, there are certain limitations. For users with visual impairments, the contrast ratio on some interactive elements could be higher to improve visibility. While the mobile version of the site retains core functionality, it compresses some features, such as the FAQ section, into expandable menus that require additional clicks, potentially complicating access to important information.</p>

  <p>The overall user experience of Capitec’s website is designed to be straightforward and efficient. The navigation menu is located prominently at the top of the page, with clear labels such as “Live Better”, “Transact”, and “Credit”, allowing users to quickly identify the services they need. Most tasks can be completed in a few clicks, and interactive feedback, such as form submission confirmations, enhances the sense of responsiveness.</p>

  <p>From a theoretical standpoint, Capitec’s design adheres to several foundational UX laws:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fitts’s Law</strong>: Larger and closer targets are quicker and easier for the user to select. Capitec uses large, easily clickable buttons to improve speed and accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Hick’s Law</strong>: The more choices a user faces, the longer they will take to decide. Capitec simplifies this by offering a limited number of straightforward options.</li>
    <li><strong>Jakob’s Law</strong>: Users prefer websites to function like others they’ve used before. Capitec mirrors typical banking website structures to reduce cognitive load.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, improvements could be made to provide a more adaptive user experience. Personalization features like recently viewed services or predictive search could streamline the user journey. Additionally, more robust contextual help—such as tooltips or embedded guidance—could empower users to navigate the site more independently.</p>

  <p>Ethical interaction design is concerned with ensuring digital platforms respect user autonomy, privacy, and inclusivity. Capitec’s website collects sensitive personal information during key interactions such as account openings and loan applications. Although a privacy policy is provided via a footer link, the policy is written in dense legal language and spans multiple sections, which may discourage thorough reading and understanding by the average user. This raises ethical concerns around informed consent and transparency.</p>

  <p>On the positive side, Capitec does not employ overtly manipulative design tactics or dark patterns. There are no deceptive pop-ups, hidden fees, or misleading buttons that pressure users into unintended actions. However, the site’s limited language options restrict its usability among non-English speakers. In South Africa’s multilingual context—with 11 official languages—offering more language options would be a critical step toward ethical inclusivity.</p>

  <p>Another ethical concern relates to accessibility. While the site is mobile-friendly and optimized for lower data usage, it lacks features that support users with disabilities, such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images. Ethical design in the South African context should prioritize these elements to ensure no user is excluded based on physical ability or internet access quality. By doing so, Capitec could align its platform more closely with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>

  <p>When compared to another online banking website, such as First National Bank (FNB), Capitec’s platform is noticeably more streamlined and minimalistic. This benefits users with limited digital literacy by reducing complexity and emphasizing core functions. However, FNB’s website offers more advanced accessibility features, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation.</p>

  <p>Additionally, FNB provides more interactive educational tools, such as budgeting calculators and savings planners, which help users make informed financial decisions. While Capitec has made strides in making banking easier for everyday users, it could expand its offerings in this area to further support financial literacy and empowerment. This would reflect a more ethically responsible UX strategy that supports not just access, but meaningful engagement.</p>

   <p>Capitec’s website demonstrates strong visual design and user-friendly navigation, contributing to an overall positive digital banking experience. It performs well in areas such as UI consistency, minimalist design, and efficient task flows. However, there are several areas where ethical considerations reveal opportunities for growth. These include improving accessibility features, expanding language support, and simplifying data privacy communication.</p>

  <p>As South Africa continues to embrace digital transformation, ethical interaction design becomes increasingly essential. For a platform that serves millions of users, many of whom face barriers related to literacy, language, and physical ability, design choices carry significant social responsibility. Capitec has built a solid foundation, but to truly embody ethical digital design, it must prioritize inclusivity, transparency, and empowerment in future iterations of its site. By doing so, it can ensure that all users—regardless of background or ability—can access and benefit from the financial services it offers.</p>

    <h1>Reflection on the Implementation of the Website</h1>

        <p>At the end of this semester, I can confidently say that my understanding of how UI and UX decisions impact code structure has significantly deepened. Designing a website that is both functional and user-friendly required careful planning across all layers—structure, style, and behaviour.</p>

<p>I used a clear and hierarchal folder structure because it helped me stay organized as the project grew. The main folder includes image folder, styles folder for my CSS scripts, and scripts folder used to store my JavaScript files, and folders for the different pages of my website, which helped me clearly distinguish between styling, behaviour and content. I used naming conventions that clearly show what that file styles and where they belong, this helps me quickly find and update the code.</p>

<p>I used semantic HTML elements such as “header”, “nav”, “main”, “article” and “section” to provide clear context to the browser. This helped define the structure of each of my pages. All interface elements were marked up with the correct semantic tags- for example, navigation links were put under “nav”, and buttons were labelled with the “button” tag rather than using “div” or “a”. This ensured correct keyboard and screen reader behaviour. My content was clearly organized using elements such as “article” for blog post and essays. This helps both search engines and users understand the hierarchy and role of each content block. Using “label” tags with form inputs, properly nesting headings and structuring regions made the site more accessible. Overall, semantic markup made my code more maintainable and scalable, whilst contributing to better accessibility and UX.</p>

<p>I included essential metadata in the “head” of each page to help browsers and search engines interpret the content correctly. This included “meta charset="UTF-8"” for proper text encoding and “meta name="viewport"” to ensure responsive behaviour on different devices. Content such blog posts and essay pages, were areas on the website that would benefit from metadata. I added “meta name="description"” in each blog page and essay to provide a summary for search engine previews, I also included author names and publication dates to give proper context and credibility to the content. My metadata was expressed fully and correctly, using the standard HTLML syntax. This ensured compatibility across browsers and devices.</p>

<p>I avoided using inline styles entirely and instead used external CSS files to ensure consistent styling across all pages. This helped keep the HTML clean and focused purely on structure and content. My CSS scripts are modular and maintainable -I split the styles into sperate files based on either page. This organization made it easier to manage and scale the styles as the site grew. To ensure the website is responsive, I used @media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes. This approach improved overall UX by making the site accessible and usable across a wide range of devices.</p>

<p>I expressed all Interaction points and functionality using JavaScript through even listeners and DOM manipulation. This allowed users to interact with elements like navigation menus, modals and other forms in dynamic and responsive ways. Repeated Functionality – such as showing and hiding content, and menus – was separated into reusable functions. This helped reduce code duplication and made codebase more maintainable. I avoided all inline scripting to maintain clean HTML and followed best practices by linking to external .js files. This separation made it easier to manage and update functionality without interfering with page structure. I used the Fetch API for async requests to dynamically load content without reloading the page. This improved performance and provided a smoother UX by reducing unnecessary delays.</p>

    <h1> Intersections between the internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality</h1>
            <p class="p-author h-card">
            <a class="u-url" href="../About me/Aboutme.html">Shivolon Govinder</a>

        <p>The Internet is frequently portrayed as a tool, that allows everybody regardless of background, have access to information, markets and social connection. Yet, how free and open the internet seems, the underlying systems are built on deep-rooted inequalities. As Greenstein, Forman, and Goldfarb (2018) argue, the internet is affected by both local problems, such as poor infrastructure or censorship, and big global imbalances, like money and power [1]. The concept of digital coloniality—where big tech companies in wealthier countries often control how people in poorer countries use technology—this shows how technology can keep old systems of power and inequalities, just in a different, more modern look. This essay explores this phenomenon through the 2024 controversy involving Google Maps, which temporarily labelled the "Gulf of Mexico" as the "Gulf of America." This case study will show how political power and global influence are built into the internet and that tech choices—though they seem neutral—can erase cultures and reinforce control.</p>

<p>In January 2024, users began reporting on Reddit and Twitter that Google Maps had labelled the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America." The change appeared across various devices and browsers, prompting widespread confusion and concern. Mexican government officials quickly denounced the modification, with Foreign Secretary Alicia Barcena condemning it as an "act of cartographic erasure." Media outlets such as El Universal, The Guardian, and Al Jazeera reported on the backlash, highlighting both its symbolic significance and geopolitical implications. The incident sparked trending hashtags like #GulfofMexico and #DigitalColonialism, framing the issue as one of the struggles of protecting local cultures from being controlled or overshadowed by powerful digital forces.</p>

<p>Although Google eventually restored the original label without offering a public apology, the damage had already been done. The renaming of a major geographic feature, even temporarily, underscores the profound power held by digital platforms over public knowledge and geopolitical representation. It is a clear demonstration that map-making, once the domain of imperial explorers and state agencies, is now controlled by the opaque algorithms and editorial choices of multinational corporations.</p>

<p>Laura DeNardis (2020) emphasizes that digital infrastructures—such as naming systems, DNS protocols, and cloud architectures—are not neutral tools but sites of geopolitical struggle [7]. "The design of internet governance technologies is never just technical—it is inherently political" [7]. In this light, the Google Maps incident cannot be dismissed as a minor error, but rather as an expression of digital power hierarchies, where decisions made by a single company based in the Global North can reshape global narratives and regional identities. Platforms like Google, with their control over cartographic data and public interfaces, operate as geopolitical actors, capable of influencing perceptions, borders, and even diplomacy.</p>

<p>According to Greenstein et al. (2018), the internet makes things such as communication and finding information cheaper, easier and faster [1]. But not everyone benefits from these things equally. Areas with great internet access, skilled workers and strong infrastructure, gain more while others fall behind —making old inequalities even bigger.</p>

<p>The Google Maps incident must be analysed within this context. The ability of a single corporation to rename a geographic feature reflects how much control of what people see and believe about the world. Greenstein et al. caution that internet platforms, through their control over digital distribution and search functions, influence not just economic outcomes but also shape consumer behaviour and public perception. In the case of Google Maps, they have the power of shaping how people around the world think about and understand geography.</p>

<p>This dynamic aligns with the critical literature on digital colonialism. As Couldry and Mejias (2019) note, that platforms such as Google and Facebook, gather data from less powerful areas, to turn it into profit, much like how resources were stolen during colonial times [2]. Zuboff (2019) adds that this system gives big companies in rich countries more knowledge and power, while users get little in return [3]. The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico can thus be seen as a microcosm of these larger trends—where data, naming rights, and representational authority are controlled by unaccountable tech giants.</p>

<p>Greenstein et al. (2018) highlight that regions with lower access to complements—such as fast internet, skilled labour, and institutional support—derive less benefit from digital innovation and are more vulnerable to exploitation [1]. In Latin America, despite rising internet penetration, many countries rely on platforms built and governed by foreign entities. Relying on tech platforms, makes it hard for local communities to create their own stories and their own digital spaces.</p>

<p>Moreover, Greenstein et al. points out that the internet can widen the gap between rich areas and poor areas, in terms of money and productivity [1]. This divide also shows up in who controls the internet—mainly rich countries and mega corporations. When Google changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico on it own, it ignored and consequently erased important local history and identity, acting as a form of modern-day knowledge-based harm.</p>

<p>Maps are not passive representations; they are instruments of power. As Benedict Anderson argued in Imagined Communities, nations are partly constructed through maps, censuses, and museums. When Google mislabels a region, it does more than make a technical error—it redefines boundaries, shifts perceptions, and alters international discourses. This is especially potent in regions with histories of colonial trauma, where representation is deeply tied to resistance and memory.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Mexico carries historical, economic, and ecological importance for Mexico and the broader Latin American region. It mislabelling as the "Gulf of America" not only reflects digital negligence but also a form of cultural imperialism that prioritizes American views over local voices and meanings. Such incidents risk becoming normalized, subtly reshaping how global users understand geography, and by extension, political legitimacy.</p>

<p>The 2024 Google Maps incident serves as a good representation of digital colonialism in practice. Drawing on Greenstein et al.'s framework, it becomes clear that the geography of the internet is not neutral—it is structured by uneven power relations that favour those with access to capital, infrastructure, and global platforms. Technology, that control what everybody sees, and knows are able preserve the old systems power and control in place.</p>

<p>This essay has argued that the symbolic power exercised by tech corporations like Google must be subject to greater scrutiny and accountability. The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico may appear trivial on the surface, but it exposes deeper structural imbalances in who gets to name, define, and map the world. For meaningful digital decolonization, there must be a concerted effort to democratize control over digital infrastructures and to amplify local voices in global platforms.</p>
